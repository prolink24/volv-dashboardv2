  - [x] Implement date preset options (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, etc.)
  - [x] Add Cancel/Apply button flow for confirming selections
- [x] Add formatting utilities for consistent date display
- [x] Implement mobile-responsive design considerations

## 3. Create Efficient Data Fetching System
- [x] Design dashboard data service with caching capabilities
  - [x] Implement query key generation based on date ranges
  - [x] Create cache invalidation strategy for outdated data
- [x] Build prefetching system for all dashboard tabs
  - [x] Add intelligent background loading of non-active tabs
  - [x] Implement stale-time configuration for cached data
- [x] Create specialized hooks for different data types
  - [x] useDashboardData hook with tab support
  - [x] useAttributionStats hook with proper cache integration

## 4. Modify Backend API Endpoints

- [x] Add usage examples and implementation notes

## 10. Final Implementation Details
- [x] All dashboard components now respect the global date range
- [x] Data is properly filtered based on selected date range
- [x] Date persistence works correctly with localStorage
- [x] Cache invalidation properly refreshes data when date range changes
