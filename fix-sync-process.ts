To prevent this issue from happening again, consider these measures:

1. Add validation in API endpoints:
   - When creating/updating deals, verify user_id against Close CRM
   - Include data integrity checks in all sync processes

2. Add monitoring for data quality:
   - Set up alerts for unassigned high-value deals
   - Run periodic validation against Close CRM data
   - Log warnings when user attribution is missing

3. Create database constraints:
   - Add NOT NULL constraint on assignedTo field for deals with status='won'
   - Add foreign key constraints to ensure valid user references

4. Modify the dashboard to show attribution warnings:
   - Display indicator for deals with missing user attribution
   - Add admin view for data quality monitoring
